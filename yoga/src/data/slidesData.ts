    presenterScript: "Wealth creation is a marathon, not a sprint. Yoga builds resilience - the ability to adapt to change and uncertainty, learn from setbacks and failures, and maintain focus during challenging times. The practice develops a long-term perspective, helping you stay committed to your goals even when immediate results aren't visible. This resilience is what separates those who create temporary wealth from those who build lasting legacies. You become antifragile - stronger after each challenge.",

    presenterScript: "Time is the great equalizer - we all have the same 24 hours each day. Yoga changes your relationship with time through present moment awareness. You experience less time pressure and anxiety, making each moment more meaningful and productive. This shift in time perception leads to increased life satisfaction and a sense of abundance. When you're not constantly rushing to the next thing, you can fully engage with what you're doing, leading to better results and greater wealth in all areas of life.",

This connection provides meaning and purpose that drives sustainable motivation. When your decisions are based on values rather than just profit, you build wealth that aligns with your deeper purpose. This spiritual foundation leads to inner peace and contentment, regardless of external circumstances. It's the difference between having money and having a meaningful life.",

This community approach to wealth creation leads to collective growth and success that far exceeds what any individual could achieve alone.",
